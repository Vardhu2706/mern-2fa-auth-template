Design Document for MERN 2FA Authentication Template
1. Introduction

The MERN 2FA Authentication Template is a secure authentication system incorporating two-factor authentication (2FA) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This template provides a foundation for developers to integrate 2FA into their applications, enhancing security for user logins.
2. Architecture Overview

The application is built using the MERN stack:

    MongoDB: Database for storing user credentials and 2FA tokens.
    Express.js: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
    React.js: Frontend library for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    Node.js: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.

3. Components
3.1 Frontend

    React Components: The user interface is built using React components.
        App.js: Main entry point of the React application.
        LoginPage.js: Handles user login and initiates 2FA.
        RegisterPage.js: Manages user registration.
        TwoFactorAuthPage.js: Page where users input their 2FA code.
        ProfilePage.js: Displays user profile and allows 2FA management.
    State Management: Uses Context API or Redux for managing application state.
    Routing: React Router for handling client-side routing.
    Styling: CSS or styled-components for styling the application.

3.2 Backend

    Express Server: Handles API requests and serves the frontend.
        server.js: Main entry point for the server.
        routes/authRoutes.js: Routes for authentication operations (login, register, 2FA).
        routes/userRoutes.js: Routes for user profile management.
    Controllers: Logic for handling API requests.
        authController.js: Functions for user registration, login, and 2FA handling.
        userController.js: Functions for managing user profiles and 2FA settings.
    Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication, 2FA verification, and error handling.
        authMiddleware.js: Protects routes that require authentication.
        twoFactorAuthMiddleware.js: Verifies 2FA tokens for sensitive routes.
    Database Models: Mongoose schemas and models.
        User.js: Schema for user data, including 2FA secret and status.
        Token.js: Schema for storing temporary 2FA tokens.

4. Data Flow

    User Registration:
        User registers through the frontend.
        Registration data is sent to the backend, which creates a new user and generates a 2FA secret.
        The user is prompted to set up 2FA (e.g., by scanning a QR code with an authenticator app).

    User Login:
        User logs in with their credentials.
        Backend verifies credentials and sends a 2FA token to the user's registered device (e.g., email, SMS).
        User enters the 2FA token on the frontend.
        Backend verifies the token and authenticates the user.

    Two-Factor Authentication:
        After initial login, the user is prompted to enter their 2FA code.
        The backend verifies the code using the stored 2FA secret.
        Upon successful verification, the user is granted access to protected resources.

    Profile Management:
        Authenticated users can view and manage their profile, including enabling/disabling 2FA.
        Profile updates are sent to the backend, which updates the user data in the database.

5. Security Considerations

    Authentication: Uses JWT tokens for user authentication.
    Two-Factor Authentication: Implements TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) for 2FA.
    Data Encryption: Sensitive data, such as passwords and 2FA secrets, are hashed or encrypted before storing in the database.
    Environment Variables: Secrets (e.g., database URI, JWT secret) are stored in environment variables.
    HTTPS: The application should be served over HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

6. Deployment

    Frontend: Can be deployed on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
    Backend: Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
    Database: MongoDB Atlas for a managed cloud database service.

7. Conclusion

The MERN 2FA Authentication Template provides a secure and scalable foundation for integrating two-factor authentication into web applications. By following best practices for security and deployment, it ensures that user data is handled safely and efficiently.
